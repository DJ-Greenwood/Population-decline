## Introduction

This Jupyter Notebook collects and analyzes data on global demographic trends, economic indicators, and other relevant factors to validate the analysis of how demographic shifts impact the global economy and fiscal stability.

## Data Collection

Data is collected from the following sources:
- United Nations World Population Prospects
- World Bank
- International Monetary Fund (IMF)
- Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)

Key datasets include:
- Population by age group
- Fertility rates
- GDP and debt levels
- Labor force participation rates
- Healthcare expenditure

## Data Analysis

The analysis covers:
- Demographic trends (aging population, declining birth rates)
- GDP-to-Debt ratio analysis
- Labor market analysis
- Healthcare expenditure analysis

## Visualization

The project includes visualizations for:
- Aging population over time
- Fertility rate trends
- Debt-to-GDP ratio trends
- Labor force participation rate trends
- Healthcare expenditure trends

## Conclusion

The analysis supports the view that demographic shifts, particularly aging populations and declining birth rates, are impacting economic variables such as debt levels, labor markets, and healthcare systems.
