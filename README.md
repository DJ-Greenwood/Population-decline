## Key Findings

- The global population aged 65 and over is projected to increase from 10% in 2022 to 16% by 2050.
- Global fertility rates are declining, with many developed countries below replacement level.
- Aging populations lead to increased government expenditures and potentially reduced tax revenues.
- Debt-to-GDP ratios are rising in many countries, with Japan exceeding 250% in 2021.
- Demographic shifts may exacerbate regional conflicts over resources and economic opportunities.
- Various economic sectors, including labor markets, healthcare, and pension funds, will be significantly impacted.

## Policy Recommendations

- Implement prudent fiscal policies to manage debt levels
- Develop strategies to address labor shortages
- Invest in education and technology to enhance productivity
- Reform pension and healthcare systems
- Foster international cooperation to mitigate regional tensions
- Utilize data-driven approaches for policy-making

## Conclusion

Demographic shifts present complex challenges that require strategic and well-informed policy responses. By understanding and addressing these implications, countries can mitigate potential economic vulnerabilities and foster sustainable growth.
